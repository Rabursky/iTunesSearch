### Notes

- After finishing the app I noticed I missed the collectionName property from models and detail display. Hope that absence of it is not a problem.
- If I had more time, I might have been a good idea to write tests for InteractorInvoker and Presenter.
- If the API can return objects other than kind:song, it is not being handled

I tried to organize code in Clean way with Infrastructure/Domain/Presenter/View separation.
